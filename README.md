# Louere
Project from DAT250 Information and Software Security 

This was a group project done my second year while pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science at University of Stavanger. 
The goal of the project was to create a website and secure it against potential cyber attacks. 

Trying to run this flask-application today might be challenging, as the dependencies and packages used havent been updated since 2021.

Grade on project: A
